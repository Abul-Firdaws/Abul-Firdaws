## 🚀 About Me

**DevOps Engineer in Training** | **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner** | **Career Transitioner**

Transitioning from 5+ years in water utility operations to DevOps engineering. Currently enrolled in an intensive **4-month DevOps Engineering program** at TS Academy, covering the complete modern DevOps toolchain: Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD, AWS, and monitoring solutions.

I bring a unique perspective combining operational reliability, process optimization, and technical problem-solving from managing critical infrastructure systems. Completed front-end development training (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React) as a complementary skill for building portfolios, landing pages, and contributing to full-stack DevOps projects.
