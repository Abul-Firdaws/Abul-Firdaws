### About Me

Transitioning from 5+ years in water utility operations to DevOps engineering. Currently enrolled in an intensive 4-month DevOps Engineering program at TS Academy, covering the complete modern DevOps toolchain: Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD, AWS, and monitoring solutions.

I bring a unique perspective combining operational reliability, process optimization, and technical problem-solving from managing critical infrastructure systems.
